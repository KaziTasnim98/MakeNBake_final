        Something I’ve noticed since starting A Spicy Perspective 5 years ago, is that many of you have a love-hate relationship with baking.

You love having sweet aromas wafting out of your oven, and having treats to share with friends and coworkers. Yet, you hate precise measuring, and the anxiety that can come with hoping your baked goods will come out of the oven as planned.

Let’s face it. The most tested baking recipes can still flop on occasion. It’s usually a culmination of little issues, you may not even be aware of, that add up to flat greasy cookies or a sunken cake disaster.

Today I’m hoping to shed some light on some basic baking tips and tricks that will help increase your odds of having perfect cupcakes, cookies, and bread every time you bake.

                    In cooking, you can throw in a handful of herbs or a little more butter, like you were adding a bit more chartreuse to an oil-painting. You can make changes as you go with no major catastrophe in the end. In baking, everything matters. Think of baking as chemistry. One small adjustment could be your undoing, but you won’t know it until you pull your cake out of the oven. When making something for the first time, read the recipe thoroughly before you start. Follow every step to a tee. Remember, the recipe developer thought each element was important enough to document, so there must be a reason for it. Do not alter the recipe until you’ve made it successfully at least once.

                <b>Measuring matters.</b>
                <p>
                    We Americans like to kick it old-school in the measuring department, relying on cups and spoons to give the proper proportions. Yet pastry chefs world-wide measure their ingredients by metric weight. The reason for this is that a cup of flour can vary greatly in weight depending on the type of flour, and how packed it is. In a perfect world, all home-cooks would use scales and metric measurement to insure exact amounts of wet and dry ingredients. As that’s never going to happen, make sure to always pour ingredients into your measuring cups, never scoop. Scooping packs the ingredient down, meaning you end up with more than you want. Always level the measuring spoons and cups with a knife or spatula. *If you are a habitual scooper and can’t stop, at least stir the ingredient (especially flour) to lighten it, before scooping into the bag.

                <b>Quality ingredients.</b>
                <p>
                    Different brands of butter, yogurt, buttermilk, and flour have varied levels of moisture, fat, and protein. These little variations can greatly effect the outcome of the final product. Use the brands the recipe developer recommends, or find brands that suit your baking needs and use them exclusively so you know how they will react in your recipe.

                <b> Ingredient temperature.</b>
                <p>
                    If a recipe calls for cold butter, melted butter, or room-temperature eggs, remember that any adjustment you make will effect the outcome. The difference between putting a dough with cold butter and one with warm melted butter in the oven, is HUGE. It results in a completely different chemical reaction.

                <b>Butter</b>
                <p>
                     loses moisture the longer it sits in the fridge, which can cause your baked goods to be dry. Buy and use the freshest butter you can find. Check dates on the packing and always select unsalted butter, because salt is a preservative… Meaning salted butter has probably been in cold storage longer than unsalted.

                <b>Leavening. </b>
                <p>
                    Baking powder, baking soda, and yeast lose their lifting power over time. I buy new baking soda and baking powder every 6 months, and toss the old container, just to be on the safe side.

            <ol>
                <b>Weather.</b>
                <p>
                    Standard “room temperature” is right around 70 degrees F. If you bake when it’s really hot outside or bitter cold, and the outside temperature is affecting the inside temperature, your results will be different. If the humidity is higher or lower than normal, your results will be different. That’s why our grandmas use to tell us never to bake on a rainy day. The heavy moisture in the air effects the ability of the dough/batter to rise and dry.

                <b>Parchment paper is your BFF.</b>
                <p>
                     Parchment paper helps batter and dough bake evenly. It also makes it possible to get brownies and cakes clean out of the pan, and stops cookies from spreading out on baking sheets. Always line baking sheets, cake pans, and baking dishes with parchment. Always.

                <b>Grease and flour</b>
                <p>
                     Cake pans should always be thoroughly greased and floured, so the cakes can slip out of the pan easily after cooling. If using a bundt pan, the more grooves your bundt cake pan has, the more you need to pay attention during the greasing and flouring process. I like to use a baking spray like Pam or Baker’s Joy that incorporates flour in the spray. I feel like I get better coverage with a spray, and the fact that it’s a onestep process is nice.
